## Linear Regression to Predict MPG (Miles Per Gallon)

The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars(company brand). The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance (mpg). Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. 

The purpose of this analysis is to design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables from the MechaCar_mpg.csv file.

### Results



Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
